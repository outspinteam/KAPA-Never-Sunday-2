Title:    Reshade.me Shader Preset "Never Sunday 2.0" for FiveM / GTAV
          (As used on OUTSPIN JDM RP servers)

INSTALL:
When I say "GTAV Root Folder" this means inside the folder where GTAV.exe is located.

1. Download and install Reshade from reshade.me.
2. Choose GTAV from the List of Games or manually pick the GTAV Root Folder. 
3. Choose DX11 then options "select none" & "select all" and finish installing reshade. (all options should be Ticked)
4. Copy the "NeverSunday2.0" preset into the GTAV Root folder.
5. When running GTAV/FIVEM use the [ HOME ] Key to toggle the Reshade interface.
6. You can select " Never Sunday 2.0 " from the drop down list.


I recommend setting up an effect hotkey (you can use any Key, i'm using F9) for toggling the shader effect.
This can be useful with UI readability, due to Bloom occasionally affecting some texts/UI.
